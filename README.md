# Electro-Chlorinator
Arduino code for  the Electrochlorination device by Tim Erwin
This Arduino code controls a device that produces sodium hypochlorite (bleach) by electrolosys of salt water. This process is known as electrochlorination.
Through the Arduino serial monitor, the user can specify how long the device will run, and during the process, the saved pH, supply voltage, voltage across the electrodes, and current through the solution is displayed. The process can be paused with a remote in order to measure the pH with an analog pH sensor. The pH reading can then be updated and saved to the display.
